# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project by Joseph DeVito and Molly Delehant

Joseph and Molly Collaborated throughout this project to divide the work evenly and contribute across all aspects of this project. Although, Joseph took main point creating the crowdfunding data base with postgres SQL where as Molly took main point on the jupyter notebooks. Throughout the project we worked with eachother to answer our questions and progress with our code. We also used online resources to find the answers we could not answer ourselves. Finally, we went to office hours for help with git pushes and pulls to improve our knowledge on that collaborative process. 

For this project, we chose to do both options to create the contacts dataframe; using Python dictionary methods and using regular expressions to compare how they worked. We felt that regex was more intuitive to use and led to less probabilty of syntax errors.
